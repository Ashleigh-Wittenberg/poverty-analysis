Project Proposal: Analyzing Poverty Levels in the U.S.

Scope and Purpose:
Our project aims to investigate the relationship between various socio-economic factors, including education attainment, marital status, regional area, and their impact on poverty levels in the United States. By leveraging data from the U.S. Census Bureau via their API and CSV files, we intend to analyze how these factors contribute to poverty rates over the years from 2012 to 2022, excluding the year 2020 to avoid data distortion due to exceptional events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data of Interest:

Education Attainment: We will examine the correlation between education levels (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, advanced degrees) and poverty rates. This will involve categorizing individuals based on their highest level of education achieved and analyzing how it affects their likelihood of living in poverty.

Marital Status: We'll explore how marital status (single, married, divorced, widowed) relates to poverty rates. This will involve understanding whether being married provides a protective effect against poverty or if single individuals are more susceptible.

Regional Area: Analyzing poverty rates across different geographic regions (e.g., states, urban vs. rural areas) to identify any disparities in poverty levels based on location. This could involve comparing poverty rates between states or between urban and rural areas.

Research Questions:

How does education attainment influence poverty levels in the U.S.?
What is the relationship between marital status and poverty rates?
Are there significant differences in poverty rates across various regional areas in the U.S.?
Data Sources:
We plan to utilize two main sources of data for our analysis:

Census.gov API: We will leverage the U.S. Census Bureau's API to access real-time data on education attainment, marital status, regional demographics, and poverty rates.

U.S. Census Bureau CSV Files: Additionally, we will utilize historical census data in CSV format obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau website. These files will provide detailed socio-economic information, including education attainment, marital status, and poverty rates, spanning the years 2012 to 2022.

Expected Outcome:
By analyzing the interplay between education attainment, marital status, regional area, and poverty levels, we aim to gain insights into the socio-economic factors driving poverty in the United States. The findings from this analysis could inform policy decisions aimed at reducing poverty and promoting economic equality across different demographic groups and geographical regions.
